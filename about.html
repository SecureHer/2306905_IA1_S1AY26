            <h2>About My Hero</h2>
            <p>
               My hero is Ginni Rometty, the former CEO and Chairwoman of 		IBM, and the first woman to ever lead the company in its 		century-long history. She is known not just for her 			leadership in technology and business, but for the way she 		champions continuous learning, courage, and growth. What 		inspires me most is her belief that “Growth and comfort do 		not coexist” — a quote that has become one of my personal 		mottos.
            </p>
            <p>
Rometty came from humble beginnings and worked her way up, showing that your background doesn't define your future, your mindset does. She didn’t shy away from challenges; she embraced them, and that’s exactly what makes her my hero. Her story reminds me that with effort, adaptability, and grit, it’s possible to lead and succeed in any space — no matter where you start.

            <h2>My Top 3 Personality Traits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Curiousity</strong> I just love learning new things. My friends call me a jack of all trades, some things I've picked up include playing the piano, crocheting, spanish, doing hair. In school my curiosity pushes me to go beyond what’s taught in class, researching further and learning how things works.  </li>
                <li><strong>Perseverance</strong> keeps me going even when assignments are difficult or stressful. I don’t give up easily, and this has helped me finish big projects and improve over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Learner</strong> I can quickly absorb new concepts in class, which helps me stay ahead and support classmates when they’re struggling. It also allows me to adapt when lessons move quickly or when I need to catch up after missing something.</li>
            </ul>

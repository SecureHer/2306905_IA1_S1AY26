                <h2>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>This chapter speaks to having specific goals, writing them down, making sure they are acheiveable in a specified timeline. It hightlights that if we don't define our goals, we just go through life without purpose.</p>
                
                <h3>How It Applies to My Life</h3>
                <p>In my life, I do have my goals and know where I want to go in life. I have outlined my long-term and short-tem goals as well. Something new from this chapter I'd like to implement is writing down the  list of 100 goals I'd like to achieve before I die. Dying is something that sounds scary, but ultimately you have to live before you die, so those 100 goals can shape your life. </p>

                <h2>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time </h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Here, Charlie talks about time being our most valuable resource. He speaks about how most people fall into the trap of prioritizing urgent distractions over important activities that will bring them closer to their goal.  </p>
                
                <h3>How It Applies to My Life</h3>
                <p> For me, I plan out how I want to spend my days but end up deviating sometimes whether taking a scroll on social media or watching anime. At the end of some days you're hit with regret and the "where did my day go" question to yourself. The chapter solidifies my need to be more serious and disciplined with my time. </p>

                <h2>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>"Show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are". The people we surround ourselves with directly influence our mindset, habits, and success. We should choose friends and mentors who inspire us, challenge us to grow, and support our ambitions. </p>
                
                <h3>How It Applies to My Life</h3>
                <p> I believe that you do pick up things from the persons you surround your self with. In my life I'm learning that it's okay to create boundaries with people who don't align with where I'm headed. It's not about being harsh or cutting people off - it's about being selective with my energy and surrounding myself with those who believe in growth, positivity, and ambition the way I do. </p>

                <h2>Chapter 7:Be a Life-Long Learner</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>True education never stops - it extends far beyond formal schooling into continuous learning through books, experiences, and mentorship. Success requires staying curious and constantly expanding your knowledge.</p>
                
                <h3>How It Applies to My Life</h3>
                <p>As a technology student, this hits home. Not only does technology grow so fast that if you stop learning you "fall off". But also life skills. Formal Schooling  gives you the foundation and you build off that so you can navigate through life better. </p>
